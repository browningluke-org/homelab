  <h1> Homelab - browningluke.dev </h1>
</div>

This homelab started in 2019, with an old laptop and a Ubuntu ISO. Since then, it has grown and evolved through many different iterations of hardware and software, until it reached the point it is at now. The scope of this project has been continually expanding, starting from a single host, to multiple VMs on a single host, to many different VMs running across local and cloud hosts.

Tinkering and expanding the homelab has become a hobby and a passion project. Many a sleepless hour have been spent improving and redoing. It has grown to be something to be proud of, but there are always more improvements and tweaks to be done.

This repo serves its purpose as documentation. However, there is also a hope that it will serve as inspiration to whomever is thinking of starting their own homelab. The explorations and pitfalls documented here hope to act as guidance and warnings for those such people.
